                    <p>This quick stress assessment is a valuable self-report questionnaire designed to assess an individual's levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. 
                        However, it's important to note that while this assessment can provide useful insights, it is not 100% accurate, and its results should be interpreted 
                        cautiously. If you find yourself in need of additional support or have concerns about your mental health, it is highly recommended to reach out to a 
                        professional mental health team or healthcare provider. They can offer a more comprehensive assessment, personalized advice, and tailored assistance 
                        based on your specific situation. Remember that seeking professional help is a crucial step in addressing mental health concerns and ensuring the most 
                        appropriate support is provided.
